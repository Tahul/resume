# Yaël GUILLOUX - Resume

Final result of this repository: [Yaël GUILLOUX - Resume](https://resume.yael.dev)

If you want you can checkout the [motivation letter template](https://github.com/Tahul/motivation-letter).

I made this with the help of [static-site-boilerplate](http://staticsiteboilerplate.com/).

I also used those cools icons, which I recommend you: [Eva Icon](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/)

It's not the cleanest code ever but if you like the template there will be no pain in adapting it to your needs.

# 👷‍♂️ Setup

You should refer to [static-site-boilerplate](http://staticsiteboilerplate.com/) documentation, but the commands are:

```bash
$ yarn // Install dependencies
$ yarn start // Run dev server
$ yarn run build:dist // Build for production
```

# 🖨 Printing

Just run the dev server, `CTRL + P` (on chrome at least).

The content is centered, and the infos parts of the web page will be hidden.

Don't hesitate to change the layout or styling, but you already have a good start with what's included.

# 🔒 Usage

I can't give you the fonts I used for my own resume, because of licensing terms, but I think you'll be able to find some cool fonts somewhere on the internets!
