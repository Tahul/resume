# YaÃ«l GUILLOUX resume :)

I made it with the help of: http://staticsiteboilerplate.com/

I also used those cools icons, which I recommend you: https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/

It's not the cleanest code ever but if you like the template there will be no pain in adapting it to your needs.

# Install & run

You should honestly refer to staticsiteboilerplate documentation, but the commands are:
```bash
$ npm install // Install dependencies
$ npm run start // Run dev server
$ npm run build:dist // Build for production
```

# Printing / PDF Export

Just run the dev server, `CTRL + P` (on chrome at least).

The content should be centered, and don't ask me why but you can actually go further 29.7cm which is supposed to be the length of a A4 papersheet when printing in PDF.

But that's fine, some more space for your incredible resume is never too much!

# Licence

I can't give you the fonts I used for my own resume, because of licensing terms, but I think you'll be able to find some cool fonts somewhere on the internets!

If you have any questions, you can ask me on Twitter: @yaeeelglx
