# Yaël GUILLOUX - Resume

[Online render](https://resume.yael.dev) 👀

Goes along with my [motivation letter template](https://github.com/Tahul/motivation-letter) 😊

# 👷‍♂️ Setup

```bash
$ pnpm // Install dependencies
$ pnpm dev // Run dev server
$ pnpm build // Build for production
```

# 🖨 Printing

Just run the dev server, `CTRL + P` (on chrome at least).

The content is centered, and the infos parts of the web page will be hidden.

Don't hesitate to change the layout or styling, but you already have a good start with what's included.

# 🔒 Usage

I can't share the fonts I used because of licensing terms, but I think you'll be able to find some cool fonts somewhere on the internets!

Any questions? you can ask me on Twitter: [@yaeeelglx](https://twitter.com/yaeeelglx)
